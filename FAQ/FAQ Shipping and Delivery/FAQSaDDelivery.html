                <h3>Delivery</h3>

<p><b>When will I receive my order?</b></p>

<p>After you have successfully placed your order, our Customer Service team will conduct a verification process and update you as soon as possible by email and SMS.</p>

<p><b>After successful verification</b> (time frame: within 24 - 48 hours after ordered date), you can expect to receive your order within the following time frame:</p>

<!--<p><b>In Metro Manila Areas</b>: 1 ・7 calendar days (except Sundays and holidays)</p>
<p><b>In Non-Metro Manila Areas</b>: 5 ・12 calendar days (except Sundays and holidays)</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: For orders of high capacity powered items (i.e. battery bank) and items with liquid content (i.e. perfume, ink cartridges) for delivery to Visayas and Mindanao areas, item(s) will be shipped via sea due to aviation/airline restrictions. Please expect an additional 15 days on top of the expected delivery date.</p>

<p>For imported items from Hong Kong (identified as screenshot below):</p>

<p>The delivery may take within 20 - 30 calendar days. Specific lead time of each product can be found on its detail page.</p>

<p>To get a more specific delivery window, please refer to www.iMARKET.com.ph/shipping/.</p>
<p>Also, you can check your order status anytime online with our Order Tracking tool www.iMARKET.com.ph/orderstatus.</p>-->

<p><b>I ordered multiple items but I only received one, where are my other items?</b></p>
<p>Whenever we encounter multiple items in a single order, we ship each item as soon as they are made available.</p>

<p>Shipping time for all items under one order number will still follow the applicable delivery time frame on your area.</p>

<p><b>Can I prearrange the date of delivery?</b></p>
<p>Our courier service is unable to provide scheduling of deliveries; therefore we can not guarantee the delivery of your order for a specific time or date.</p>

<p>Yet you can rest assured we are working closely with our service partners to allow us to better serve you in the future.</p>

<p><b>Do you deliver during weekends and holidays?</b></p>
<p>Your orders may be delivered on a weekend or a holiday depending on our courier's availability. You will be notified should your order be delivered outside of business days.</p>

<p><b>I need my order now, can iMARKET speed up the delivery?</b></p>
<p>Although we currently do not have an option for express delivery, we always ensure that your orders are delivered within the promised delivery timeframe.</p>

<p><b>I just received an email saying that my item has been shipped. When will I receive my order?</b></p>
<p>Once shipped, you should receive your order within the promised delivery timeframe of 1・ business days for Metro Manila areas and 5・2 business days for non-Metro Manila areas. Please note that deliveries for imported items may take longer.</p>

<p><b>I ordered multiple items, but why did I receive only one email and one tracking number?</b></p>
<p>We usually send one notification per order number even if this includes multiple items. You will however receive one notification for every item that is tagged as shipped or out for delivery.</p>

<p><b>How can I know the exact date and time of delivery?</b></p>
<p>Our courier service is unable to provide the exact date and time of delivery however we can assure you that your order will be delivered within our promised delivery time frame.</p>

<p><b>Can I receive a call before delivery?</b></p>
<p>You will receive a SMS notification once your order is out for delivery and our rider will communicate with you via call or SMS upon arrival at your address.<p>

<p><b>Why do I receive my order in separate deliveries?</b></p>
<p>iMARKET is a platform for various merchants which is why items may come from different places.</p>

<p><b>Can I cancel my order after order has been shipped?</b></p>
<p>For cancellation requests, please call us or send us an email through www.iMARKET.com.ph/contact so we can advise our courier to stop the delivery ahead of time.</p>

<p><b>What if I am not at home when the package arrives?</b></p>
<p>You will need to sign a letter of authorization as a confirmation and indicate a second party at the point of purchase to identify the person.</p>

<p>You can also contact our customer service at www.iMARKET.com.ph/contact immediately after purchasing to inform us. The third party should present a valid ID along with the letter of authorization from you.</p>

<!--<p>Is there any domestic area iMARKET can not deliver to?</p>
<p>iMARKET Philippines can deliver to all serviceable areas. However, there are still some geographical restrictions. If our couriers are not able to deliver to your area, we will inform you through call right after you place your order.</p>

<p>We work in partnership with LBC. For orders within Metro Manila, we deliver within 7 business days upon finalizing the full payment. For orders outside Metro Manila, we deliver within 12 business days with the exception of some remote areas.</p>

<p>Does iMARKET offer international shipments?</p>
<p>International shipment is not available at iMARKET at the moment.</p>-->

<p><b>Can iMARKET deliver the package to my office?</b></p>
<p>iMARKET will deliver your order following the address you provide during checkout, whether it is your house address or office address.</p>

<p>In case you want to change your delivery address afterward, please send us your inquiry at www.iMARKET.com.ph/contact, we will help you to change the address and also send you a confirmation once done.</p>

<p>NOTE:Delivery addresses can only be changed if the orders have not been endorsed or packed by iMARKET or our Partner merchant. Once endorsed, we can no longer change the invoices since these are already printed and orders have already been handed over to our couriers.</p>

<p><b>Can I pick up my order at iMARKET office?</b></p>
<p>iMARKET doesn't offer this option for now.</p>

<p><b>Can I purchase multiple items and have it delivered to different shipping addresses?</b></p>
<p>We currently do not offer delivering different items to different addresses for the same order.</p>

<p>Should you want to have your items delivered to different addresses, we would recommend placing different orders (items to be delivered to the same shipping address should be put together in 1 order).</p>
