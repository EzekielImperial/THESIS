                  <p><b>How do I know if my cancellation request was accepted?</b></p>

                  website indicating you have successfully sent your cancellation request to us. iMARKET will process your request within 60 minutes upon
                  receiving the request.</p>

                  <p>To know whether or not your order was canceled, you can log into your iMARKET's account and check "My Orders" page. If your item
                  or order status is “Canceled”, you can rest assured that it was canceled successfully.</p>

                  <p>In case your cancellation request is not processed by iMARKET after 60 minutes, your order may have already been shipped out and
                  cannot be canceled. Please contact us via www.iMARKET.com.ph/contact for further assistance.</p>

                  <p><b>I just canceled my order. When will I get my money back?</b></p>

                  depends on your refund method and issuing bank.</p>
