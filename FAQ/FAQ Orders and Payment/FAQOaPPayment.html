                  <h3>Payment</h3>

                      <p><b>What are the payment methods available?</b></p>
                      <p>To bring you the best online shopping experience, we offer multiple payment methods:</p>

                      <p>Cash On Delivery</p>
                      <p>Credit/ Debit Card (Mastercard, Visa, AMEX and JCB)</p>
                      <p>BDO Installment</p>
                      <p>Philippine-Paypal accounts</p>
                      <p>helloPay</p>
                      <p>For more details on each payment method, please refer to www.iMARKET.com.ph/payment-methods.</p>

                      <p>See below to know how to choose payment method during checkout</p>



                      <p><b>How do I know if my payment transaction is successful?</b></p>
                      <p>There are 3 simple steps in checking the success in Order Creation.</p>

                      <p>If an account has been created you can go to the Order Tracking Page which can be found on the upper right hand
                        corner of the website. The Order Tracking Page would show you orders made from the time the account was created to
                        the most recent.</p>
                      <p>Check your email and phone. An email and sms notification will be sent out once Order has been successfully made.</p>
                      <p>If all else fails, you can call us at our hotline or send us a message via www.iMARKET.com.ph/contact to check if
                        the order went through.</p>
                      <p><b>What is COD?</b></p>
                      <p>COD stands for Cash on Delivery. This is a payment method offered by iMARKET that gives you the opportunity to pay
                        for the item/s you have ordered only when it gets delivered. A few areas in the Philippines are not covered by COD
                        transactions due to geographical restrictions. We highly recommend that the exact change is prepared for your
                        convenience as our delivery agents may not have that much change on hand.</p>

                      <p>Simple. Secure. Hassle-free! Enjoy having a peace of mind when you purchase using COD at iMARKET.</p>


                      <p><b>How do I pay cash for items not available for COD?</b></p>

                      <p>Pay using helloPay when you shop for items that are not available for COD! Create a helloPay account and
                        add money to it by paying cash at our over-the-counter partners before you shop. Scroll down for more information
                        about helloPay.</p>

                      <p><b>Which credit cards are accepted for payment?</b></p>
                      <p>iMARKET accepts all major international and local credit and debit cards that are supported by VISA, Mastercard,
                        JCB or AMEX.</p>

                      <p>For foreign-issued cards, please tick on the "Bill to a different address" box in our check out page.
                        It is where you can input the billing address for your credit card.</p>

                      <p>Your card details will be protected using industry-leading encryption standards.</p>

                      <p>You can read more about our Payment methods at www.iMARKET.com.ph/payment-methods.</p>

                      <p><b>Can I use a credit card which is not under my name to place an order?</b></p>
                      <p>Yes, you can as long as you get the consent of the Credit Card holder. iMARKET validates these type of transactions
                        by calling the Card Account Holder. To ensure the order is not cancelled, please tick on the "Bill to a different
                        address" box in our check out page. You need to enter the Full name indicated in the Credit Card and the Billing
                        address of the credit card. Please also provide the contact details of the Primary account holder and advise the
                        Account holder to <p>be available during validation.</p>

                      <p><b>Why am I not able to make a payment with my Paypal account?</b></p>
                      <p>We encourage you to use a Philippine Paypal account when making a purchase through Paypal on our website.</p>

                      <p>While most international Paypal accounts are accepted by Paypal Philippines, you might encounter issues from some
                        restricted country accounts.</p>

                      <p><b>Why was my order charged wrong amount?</b></p>
                      <p>Your order might have included additional charges like shipping and/or bulky fees. For more information on these
                        extra fee terms, please refer to www.iMARKET.com.ph/shipping and at the product page of the item you bought.</p>

                      <p><b>Do you keep my credit card details?</b></p>
                      <p>Your security is important to us and we take it very seriously. Every credit card transaction occurs within a
                        secure environment. We do not retain your credit card information after your order is completed; it is submitted
                        directly to our banks.</p>

                      <p>If you are using a credit card which is not under your name, please ensure that you get the consent of the Credit
                        Card holder as iMARKET validates these type of transactions by calling the primary Account Holder.</p>

                      <p><b>When can I request for a Sales Invoice?</b></p>
                      <p>All Sales invoice should be included on the package upon delivery. If for some reason our merchants have not
                        included the Invoice, please contact us within 30 days upon receipt for us to send one out right away.</p>

                      <p>A scanned copy of the Sales Invoice will be sent to you 3 to 5 business days from the date of request and a physical
                        copy will be mailed to you right after if you require one.</p>

                      <p>Due to the number of Invoices served by our Merchants on a daily basis and the assumption that you have received
                        your product in good order with the correct Sales Invoice attached, we may not be able to accomodate any request for
                        copies after 30 days from the receipt of your item.</p>

                      <p><b>How can I pay using helloPay?</b></p>
                      <p>Pay with helloPay in three easy steps: (1) register for a free account here before you shop on iMARKET,
                        (2) add money to your account via credit or debit card, online banking, or over-the-counter options, and
                        (3) shop at iMARKET, choose helloPay at checkout, and follow the steps. That's it! Make sure to add funds to your
                        helloPay account before shopping to make your payment even faster.</p>

                      <p>If you don't have an account but you have a Visa or MasterCard credit or debit card, just choose helloPay as your
                        payment option and follow the steps.</p>
